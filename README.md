# Sai Nandan

I build and automate reliable cloud systems on AWS with a focus on monitoring, failure detection, and automated recovery. My work centers on understanding how infrastructure behaves in real-world conditions and designing systems that surface issues early and fix them with minimal human intervention.

My learning and development style is project-driven. I design small, production-style systems that simulate real operational challenges such as service downtime, cost leakage, and visibility gaps, then evolve them using AWS-native tools and Linux-based automation.
