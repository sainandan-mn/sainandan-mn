# Sai Nandan

I approach engineering with a strong emphasis on clarity, ownership, and system thinking. Instead of treating tools as isolated pieces, I focus on understanding how components interact across the full lifecycle — from configuration and execution to validation and deployment.

My learning style is project-based: I build small, production-style systems that reflect real-world engineering problems and evolve them step by step.
