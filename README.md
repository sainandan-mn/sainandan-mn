# Sai Nandan

I am an engineering graduate with a strong interest in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and system reliability. I focus on learning through hands-on implementation and ownership of real-world projects, with an emphasis on building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and well-documented.

I have practical experience working with Linux-based environments, cloud fundamentals, automation, and data analytics. I am currently preparing for entry-level roles where I can support cloud and DevOps teams, contribute to day-to-day operations, and continue developing my technical depth under experienced mentorship.
