# Sai Nandan

I build automation-driven systems that improve the reliability, performance, and visibility of software in real-world environments. My work sits at the intersection of Python engineering, Linux systems, and cloud infrastructure, where code is used to monitor, control, and improve how systems behave in production.

My approach is project-based and iterative. I design small, production-style systems that simulate real engineering challenges such as service failures, performance bottlenecks, and cloud cost leakage, then evolve them using clean code, observability, and automation.
